codejam
=======

The project is in the absolute basic state at the moment. We've got it set up so that you should be able to check out the code using this command: [git clone git@github.com:johnnyfoe/codejam.git]

If you navigate to the 'source' folder, run 'bundle install' and then 'rails s'

go to your browser and navigate to localhost:3000/
You should get the basic page up and running! Wewp!
